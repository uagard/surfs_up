# Surfs Up Challenge (Analysis):
__________________________________________________


# Background:

While on vacation in Hawaii, we developed a passion for surfing and would want to invest part of our earnings in a surf and ice cream store. However, we must persuade other investors, such as W.Avey, to invest in our company. We'll achieve this by monitoring weather data given by W.avy to ensure that there will be enough consumers between seasons to keep the business going all year.

# Objectives

-  Determine the most important statistics data for the month of June.
-  Determine the most important statistics information for the month of December.
-  Compare and contrast your findings from June to December.
-  Make two or three recommendations for additional investigation.


## Observations

I ran statistical studies on the temperature between June and December to get a brief glimpse of the lowest, maximum, and average temperatures at different periods of the year. The following are the findings of these statistical studies (shown below):

-  The average temperature in June was about 75 degrees, with a highest of 85 degrees and a lowest of 64 degrees.
-  The average temperature in December was about 71 degrees, with a high of 83 degrees and a low of 56 degrees.
-  The temperature figures for both months were closely clustered data, with standard deviations of 3.26 degrees in June and 3.75 degrees in December.

## Summary

In summary, it can be concluded that Hawaii is an excellent place to open up a surf and shake shack based on the temperature data.  Temperatures are mild and warm year round with averages of about 75 degrees at the height of Summer and about 71 degrees at the depths of Winter.  This means that locals and tourists will be at the beaches surfing and relaxing year-round, providing a consistent customer base for our business.

Temperature, however, is not the only weather factor that I need to keep in mind while performing weather analysis on our potential vendor location.  Excessive rain can prevent people from heading out to the beach.  I have executed queries for the months of June and December that plot the precipitation recordings at our target location (station USC00519281) in order to ensure we are indeed making the correct data-based decision for our venture location.


### Conclusion

The precipitation histogram for the month of June shows 120 instances of no precipitation with only a few occurances of more than 1 inch of rain.  The December histogram shows similar results with over 140 instances of no precipitation, but more instances of precipitation exceeding 1 inch of rain.  Nonetheless, these precipitation charts support our original temperature-based conclusion that Hawaii, and in particular our target location, is an ideal location for our venture.
