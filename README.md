# Surfs Up Challenge (Analysis):
__________________________________________________


# Background:

While on vacation in Hawaii, we developed a passion for surfing and would want to invest part of our earnings in a surf and ice cream store. However, we must persuade other investors, such as W.Avey, to invest in our company. We'll achieve this by monitoring weather data given by W.avy to ensure that there will be enough consumers between seasons to keep the business going all year.

# Objectives

-  Determine the most important statistics data for the month of June.
-  Determine the most important statistics information for the month of December.
-  Compare and contrast your findings from June to December.
-  Make two or three recommendations for additional investigation.


## Observations

I ran the statistical studies for the temperatures between the month of June and December. This was done in order to get an understanding of the lowest, maximum, and average temperatures at different times of the year. Below is the findings of these statistical studies:

-  The average temperature in June was about 75 degrees, with a highest of 85 degrees and a lowest of 64 degrees.
-  The average temperature in December was about 71 degrees, with a high of 83 degrees and a low of 56 degrees.
-  The temperature figures for both months were closely clustered data, with standard deviations of 3.26 degrees in June and 3.75 degrees in December.

## Summary

Based off of the temperature data provided, it can be concluded that Hawaii is an excellent place to open our new business venture. The temperatures are pleasant and warm year round with averages of about 75 degrees at the height of summer and about 71 degrees at the depths of winter.  It is a belief that locals and tourists will be at the beaches enjoying these conditions and relaxing year-round. This will in turn provided our business with a consistent customer base.

Another factor to keep in mind when looking at potential vendor locations is rain. THe possibility of excessive rain can prevent people from heading out to the beach. There were queries created for the months of June and December. These quereies showed the precipitation recordings at our target location (station USC00519281).  This data will be used in order to ensure we are making the correct data-based decision for our venture location.


### Conclusion

The precipitation histogram for the month of June shows 120 instances of no precipitation with only a few occurances of more than 1 inch of rain.  The December histogram shows similar results with over 140 instances of no precipitation, but more instances of precipitation exceeding 1 inch of rain.  Nonetheless, these precipitation charts support our original temperature-based conclusion that Hawaii, and in particular our target location, is an ideal location for our venture.
